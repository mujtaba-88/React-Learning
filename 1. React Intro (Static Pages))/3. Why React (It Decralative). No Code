*** Declerative ***
What should be done ?
Just tell me what to do and I'll worry about how I get itdone.

*** Imperative ***
How should it be done?
Describe me every step on how to do something and I' ll do it.

*** Declerative Implementation ***
ReactDOM.render(<h1 className="header">Hello, React!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"))

/* 
Challenge - recreate the above line of code in vanilla JS by creating and
appending an h1 to our div#root (without using innerHTML).

- Create a new h1 element
- Give it some textContent
- Give it a class name of "header"
- append it as a child of the div#root
    
*/


*** Imperative Implementation  ***
// const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
// h1.textContent = "This is an imperative way to program"
// h1.className = "header"
// document.getElementById("root").append(h1)
